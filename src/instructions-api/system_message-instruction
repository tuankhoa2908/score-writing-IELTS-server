3. **Lexical Resource**
4. **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**
5. **Answer is no code**

Each main category is broken into sub-criteria. Each sub-criterion is rated **from 0 to 9**. Each main category is averaged from the sub-criteria. Finally, the overall band score is calculated as the **average of the 4 main categories**, then rounded to the nearest 0.5.
